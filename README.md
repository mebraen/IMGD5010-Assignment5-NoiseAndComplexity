# IMGD5010-Assignment5-NoiseAndComplexity
This project uses randomness and noise along with mouse interaction to create a blizzard effect in P5JS.

## Inspiration
My inspiration for this project was the many snow storms recently where I live :)

## The Code
The code attached in the file blizzard.js uses randomness to assign properties to each agent (snowflake). Each snowflake has a random speed, noise scale, and size associated with it. This allows each snowflake to be unique. The speed is used to determine how fast the snowflakes are falling, making it so that each snowflake falls at a slightly different speed. The noise scale is used to calculate the noise on the x axis, making the snowflakes appear to sway in the breeze. The user can interact with the blizzard by clicking and dragging the mouse. Dragging the mouse down increases the speed, up decreases the speed, to the left shifts the wind to the left, and to the right shifts the wind to the right. You can find the demonstration of my code [here](https://editor.p5js.org/mebraen/full/9TS0B0_jC).


## The Blizzard Accomplishment
Overall I was going for a blizzard effect, and I think that I accomplished this. The snowflakes are random enough that they appear individual while also looking natural due to the noise of them swaying back and forth. The mouse interaction is also a nice touch, allowing the user to control the storm. Creatively I think I did a good job of depicting what I wanted to accomplish.
